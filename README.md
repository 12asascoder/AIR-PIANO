# AIR-PIANO
Air Piano is a Project made using python and a few libraries that uses hand gestures to control the steps of piano tiles and thus playes notes based  on them 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features:-
Hand Tracking: Detects fingers using OpenCV & cvzone.

MIDI Output: Sends MIDI signals to simulate piano sounds.

Automatic Sustain: Notes sustain for 2 seconds before stopping.

D Scale Chords: Plays chords mapped to different finger positions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project uses computer vision and MIDI synthesis to play D-scale chords based on hand gestures. It employs OpenCV, cvzone, and pygame.midi to detect finger positions and trigger corresponding chords, sustaining them for 2 seconds before stopping automatically.
